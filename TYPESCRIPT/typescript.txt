reactjs
---------------------
react is the library,javascript library
it is realsed by facebook
we can develop web application
web application developed in two ways
1.jsx
    jsx stands for javascript+xml
    it is a scripting language
    it won't fallows the oops concept
2.tsx
    tsx stands for typescript+xml
    it is a programmng language 
    introduced by facebook
    it fallows the oops concept


type script:
-----------------------------------------------
type script is the programming (compiler based language) language
typwscript given by microsoft.
typescript is used to bild the "ReactJS","NodeJS","Angular" application
typescript is fallows the object oriented programming languaga
    example:
                inhertance
                polymorphism
                abstraction 
                encapuslation
type script is also called as "superset of javascript"
we will save the typescript file with ".ts" extension
visual studio code is the suggestable IDE to build the type script
visual studio code als calles as vscode
vscode is the open source IDE provided by microsoft
browser can not understand type script
so as a type script developer we neet to convert typwscript to equalent java script
conversion from typescript to equalent javascript called as transpilation
"TSC" tools helps tp oerform transpilation
"TSC" stands for typescript compiler
"TSC" tool available in typwscript software.
NPM stands for node packaging manager

download and install nodejs
instal typescript
>> npm install -g typescript
npm stands for noe packagingmanager
npm present in NodeJS
-g stands for global installation

install vusual studio code

in cmd prompt
node -v
npm -v
tsc --version


how todo transpilation
------------------------------
>>> tsc demo.ts
>>> node demo.js

variable
---------------------------
varable is used to store the data
string, number, boolean, indefined, null etc.,
 "var","let","const"
 "let/const" is introduced in ES6
 a-z,A-Z,0-9,$ and _ 
 varable does not start with "number"
 syntax:
    let variablename:datatype="value"


string:
-------------------------------
collecction of characters called as string
" ",' ',` ` and(` ` backtick operator ---> ES6)
backtick operator is used to define the paragraphs
it is also called as template literals

functions:
--------------------------------------------
particual bussiness logic called as functions
functions are used to reuse the business logic 
the function without name called as anonymous function
anonymous functions also called as arrow function
it is introduced in ES6

syntax:
-------
1.function defination
2. function calling

function defination
-------------------
let variable:datatype=(arg1:dataype,arg2:datatype....... argn:datatype):returntype{
    business logic;
}

function calling
-------------------
variablename(parm1,param2,.......paramn);


class:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class is a collection of variable and function called as class
we will create the class by using "class" keyword
we will create the object to the class by using "new" keyword
typscript supports following midifires
1.public
2. private
3.protected
 private modifier suggestable to variable
 public modifier suggestable to functionswe will define the constructor by using "constructor" keyword


 readonly 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 readonly we can read the data by won't modify


interface:
-----------------------------------------------------------
you know only declaration
if we don't know inplementation we will chooose interfaces.
we will define/declare interface by using "interface" keyword
implementation provided by either "JSON" or "CLASS"


abstraction 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
id we know the partial implementations the we will go abstraction/abstract classes 


polymorphism
-------------------------------------------
behaves like many called as polymorphism
1.function overriding
    overriding the parent class functionality wiht child class functionality called as function overridint

2.function overloading
    more than one function with different datatypes calles as function overloading

module:
-----------------------------------------------
collection of module is called project
execution process 
>> tsc --module commonjs module.ts
>> node module.js



interview questions:
-------------------
enum:
-----
we can create our own data type/custom data type is called enum
